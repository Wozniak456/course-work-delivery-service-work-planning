> ## Course work on the discipline "Research of operations in information and management systems"
> Task: Delivery Service Work Planning

During the course project, the following tasks were accomplished:

- Developed and implemented a greedy algorithm for solving the delivery service work planning problem programmatically.

- Developed and implemented a hybrid algorithm with local optimization based on pairwise permutation within a single machine.

- Implemented an individual task generator.

- Experimentally researched the developed algorithms.

- Conducted a comparative analysis of these algorithms.
